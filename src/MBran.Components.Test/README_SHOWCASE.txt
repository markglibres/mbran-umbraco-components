=====================
- Umbraco workflow
	- Doc Type (page)
		- inheritance
		- compositions
	- Template (view)
		- render multiple partial views 
			- extensions or helpers for logic in views
			- logic within views
			- constant variables for view path
			- model mapping to viewmodels
	- Controllers 
		- custom controllers to handle logic for the page rendered
	- Problems:
		- cluttering, too many helpers, and extensions 
		- constants everywhere
		- no conventions
		
- Goal:
	- conventions on partial paths using default MVC logic
	- less constant variables esp for view paths
	- easy to debug
	- portable components (can be packaged)
	- quick way to add new components
	- minimize redundant code on mapping page to a view model 
			
- MBran Components
	- Concept:
		- Page (Doc type)
			- compositions over inheritance
			- consists of reusable components
			- auto mapping of current page to component model
			- auto routing of view paths
		- Components
			- with own model
			- can have own logic
			- with own template
			- independent from page
		- Document Types
			- Composition 
				- starts with "_Has" 
				- i.e. _HasTextAndMedia, _HasMetaHeader
			- Component 
				- reusable
				- one single feature
				- i.e. TextAndMediaLeft, TextAndMediaRight
			- Page
				- can have multiple components
				- has multiple compositions
				- i.e. Home
					- components (nested content)
						- TextAndMediaLeft
						- TextAndMediaRight
					- _HasTextAndMedia
					- _HasMetaHeader
						
	- Implementation:
		- View Rendering
			- Render part of a page as a component model directly to a view
		- Controller Rendering
			- a view rendering
			- with custom logic on controller
		- Module Rendering
			- custom logic with own views
			- complex logic, i.e. one or more features involved
